<!--Curriculum Overview-->
    <div class="Curriculum">
        <h2>Curriculum Overview</h2>
        <h5>Math</h5>
        <p>Using the American Common Core State Standards, the mathematics program challenges students to make meaning of mathematics using models, pictures and clear explanations of their thinking. The program focuses on the "why" of mathematics not on memorization of procedures or algorithms.</p>
        <h5>Science</h5>
        <p>Using the NGSS Framework, science education aims to challenge and inspire 21st century students to be scientifically literate. The framework adopts a three-dimensional approach to instruction: Disciplinary Core Ideas, Crosscutting Concepts and Engineering. NGSS performance expectations do not involve rote memorization of content; instead, the focus is on cultivating students' natural curiosity and pushing their creative boundaries by engaging them in exploring connections across the four domains of science: physical science, life science, earth and space science, and engineering design. In addition, the NGSS standards are aligned to the Common Core Mathematics and Language Arts Standards. When students are learning about science, they are also enhancing their skills in reading, writing and math.</p>
        <h5>Social Studies</h5>
        <p>Using the C3 Framework, Social Studies is focused as much on the future as it is on the past. Using the four dimensions of C3, students learn applicable skills and do deep dives into relevant topics using the historical content as a guide. The C3 Framework focuses on making students responsible citizens of the 21st century - problem-solvers of a new and rapidly changing world.</p>
        <h5>English Language Arts</h5>
        <p>Using the American Common Core State Standards, the language arts program helps students learn what savvy readers and writers do. Students engage in meaningful activities to practice skills they need in order to tackle a wide variety of texts. They are immersed in the writing process and continuously work toward crafting pieces that have a clear purpose, while understanding that they are writing for a particular audience.</p>
        <h5>Elementary and Middle School</h5>
        <p>ASD provides a full American curriculum for its students that is standards-based. This model of unit and course design has been shown to be more innovative in terms of moving to increased student-centered classrooms focused on learner agency.

            Our continually updated curricular areas are designed with learner outcomes as our focus and excellent text materials are used as primary sources of information. Teachers have multiple supplementary resources available to help them effectively address the outcomes, including our outstanding library resources.</p>
